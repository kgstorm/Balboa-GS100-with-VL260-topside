## Description

This project adds an ESP32 to a Balboa GS100 (VL260 topside) to send and receive data using ESPHome and Home Assistant. It provides wiring, measurement notes, and an ESPHome configuration to integrate the spa panel with Home Assistant.

This has only been tested with a Balboa GS100 control board and the VL260 topside panel, but this project should work for any spa with the VL260 topside panel. I imagine any 4-button Balboa topside controller would have a very similar setup. 

The GS100 has an RJ45 connector that sends and receives data to the topside panel. This project taps into that signal by creating a project box that the topside panel will plug into, and then with another ethernet type cable connect the project box back to the GS100 control board.

## Software Installation

1. Copy the `esp32-spa.yaml` file and the entire `esp32-spa` folder into your Home Assistant config folder under the `esphome/` subfolder. The folder layout should look like:

```
config/
└── esphome/
    ├── esp32-spa.yaml
    └── esp32-spa/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── binary_sensor.py
        ├── esp32-spa.h
        └── sensor.py
```

2. Edit the UNITS key in the esp32-spa.yaml file to set the temperature units. 

3. In Home Assistant go to **ESPHome**, click **New Device** → **Import From File**, and select `esp32-spa.yaml`.

4. `esp32-spa.yaml` will also look for a `secrets.yaml` file inside the **esphome/** folder for the following keys: `api_key`, `wifi_ssid`, `wifi_password`, `ota_password`, and `ap_password`.

## Wiring

- An attempt was made with an ESP8266, but the Wi‑Fi and ISR requirements (or pin/boot choices) caused persistent boot issues, so the project uses an ESP32 which worked reliably.
- The 4 buttons on the topside panel act like switches that connect to 5V when pressed, but when not pressed show ~2.5V. To avoid interfering with the panel we used optocouplers to reproduce the switch signals safely.
- For the data and clock lines we use a simple voltage divider (2.2k and 4.7k) to reduce the voltage down to ~3.4V, then add a 220Ω series resistor to the ESP32 GPIOs.

ESP32 DEVKIT V1 GPIO assignments:

| Spa RJ45 pin | Function | Wiring diagram color | GPIO pin |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | VIN | red | VIN |
| 2 | Warm Button | orange | 25 |
| 3 | Light Button | purple | 27 |
| 4 | GND | black | GND |
| 5 | Display Data | green | 34 |
| 6 | Clock | yellow | 35 |
| 7 | Jets Button | blue | 32 |
| 8 | Cool Button | lime green | 26 |

## Frontend

This repository includes a Home Assistant custom card for controlling and monitoring the spa. To install the frontend component:

1. Copy `spa-control-card.js` into your Home Assistant `www/` folder (e.g., `config/www/spa-control-card.js`).
2. Open the dashboard where you want to add the card, click the three-dot menu (upper-right) and select **Manage resources**.
3. Click **Add resource**, set **URL** to `/local/spa-control-card.js` and **Resourse Type** to `Javascript Module`, then save.
4. Add the card to your dashboard via **Add Card** → search for **Spa Control Card** or use the raw YAML (below)
5. For the Device Name, enter whatever you named your esp device. If you did not modify the yaml file, enter 'esp32-spa'. Given the device name, the frontend can discover all the required entities.

```yaml
type: 'custom:spa-control-card'      # required
device_name: 'esp32-spa'      # required - replace with your esp device name
title: 'Hot Tub Control'     # optional - card title
high_setting: 103         # optional - Temp for one button press to high temp 
low_setting: 80    # optional - Temp for one button press to low temp

```

If the card doesn't appear immediately, try a hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) or clear the browser cache.

## Measurements

- The clock stream consists of 4 packets of data: three packets of 7 bits and a final packet with 3 bits.

- Packet 1 (bits referenced MSB→LSB as 6 5 4 3 2 1 0):
  - Bits 5 and 4 HIGH indicate a `1` in the hundreds digit (Fahrenheit display).
  - Bit 2 is the heater status (when the heater is on this bit pulses).

- Packets 2 & 3: used for the display characters where each bit maps to a segment of the 7-seg style character. Bit mapping (MSB→LSB):

```
Bit -> Segment
6   = top
5   = top-right
4   = bottom-right
3   = bottom
2   = bottom-left
1   = top-left
0   = center
```

- Packet 4 (3 bits):
  - Bit 2 = pump status
  - Bit 1 = light status

 - The remaining bits always appear LOW in my observation. I use them as a frame checksum. They are: Packet 1 bits 6, 3, 1, 0 and Packet 4 bit 0 (MSB to LSB).


- Timing observations (from logic analyzer):
  - Clock pulses: ~16 µs ON with ~21 µs gap between pulses.
  - Data pulses: ~17.5 µs with ~20 µs gap; data is sampled on the rising edges of the clock.
  - Each frame consists of 24 bits (4 packets of 7 bits, 7 bits, 7 bits, and 3 bits.
  - Between each frame is a LOW segment of ~19ms.

Logic analyzer screenshot:
- In the screenshot below, the top signal is the data signal and the bottom is the clock.
  - Packet 1 (bits 6543210)
    - bit 6, 1, 0 LOW: used as a checksum (always LOW)
    - bit 5, 4 LOW: indicates the hundreds digit of the display will be blank
    - bit 2 HIGH: indicates the heater is on
  - Packet 2 (bits 6543210)
    - bit 6, 5, 4 HIGH: Translates into the number 7
  - Packet 3 (bits 6543210)
    - bit 6, 5, 4, 1, 0 HIGH: Translates into the number 9
  - Therefore the display will show the temp of 79 degrees
  - Packet 4 (bits 210)
    - bit 2 HIGH: indicates the jets (in this case the circulation pump) is on
    - bit 1 LOW: indicates the lights are off
    - bit 0 LOW: used as a checksum (always LOW)
